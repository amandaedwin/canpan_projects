    "The H-rich material accreted by the white dwarf is being compressed by the force of gravity and, as a result of this compression, it is getting heated up until H is ignited leading to a thermonuclear explosion. A large amount of heat released by this runaway H burning at the base of the accreted envelope triggers convection in the envelope and causes its expansion. It is interesting that a similar sequence of events, namely air intake, its compression, fuel\n",
    "injection and combustion, finally followed by exaust of burning products, takes place in a four-stroke diesel engine (see the animation below). The similarity between the nova and diesel engine duty cycles is enhanced by the fact that a successfull nova explosion also needs an injection (mixing) of CO- or ONe-rich material from an underlying CO or ONe WD that serves as catalyst for H burning in the CNO cycle."
