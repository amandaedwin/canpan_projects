There are different trajectories available for processing in the directory 
nova_cases. Please select one in the top section of the run_me.sh
script. 

Then make the ppn.exe code with make command:
$ make distclean
$ make

Then, run the run_me.sh script.

Once the simulation is completed a few scripts (abu_chart.py,
plot_abu_evolution.py, plot_isoabund.py) are executed to produce some
standard plots. All of these use the methods provided by the ppn.py
module (import ppn). This is commented by default because it requires
the user to set the variable PPN_DIR so that the script finds the
plotting scripts in utils/pylib.

clean_output	clean directory for a fresh run, all relevant files from 
	  	any previous run will be deleted
copy_case.sh  	if you want to save a run use this script with the dir
		name as the first and only argument (e.g. copy_case.sh my_case1)
		to save all files and the input deck files into dir, 
		you can later use the data in this dir for plotting
run_me.sh	use this to launch a new run, select the trajectory type
		in the header section of this script

The one thing that you may want to change from one run to another is to apply
a factor to any of the rates by editing the multiplication factor 1.000E+00 
in the last but one column of the reaction list following the isotope list
in the file networksetup.txt. This file is automatically generated with the
option ININET=0 in ppn_physics.input, or used as input (bypassing the network
generation) with ININET=3. You can also turn any of the rates or species on 
or off by toggling the boolean (T or F) in the third or second column. 

The trajectories have been provided by Pavel Denisenkov, based on his 
MESA simulations of CO and ONe nova (Denissenkov et al. 2013, paper I and II).
