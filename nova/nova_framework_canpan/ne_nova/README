The "H5_out_ne_MWD_TWD_dM/dt_#_mixed" directories contain MPPNP-processed hdf files for ONe nova models.
Main model parameters are indicated in the directory name,
where MWD and TWD are the initial WD mass and central temperature, dM/dt is the letter-encoded mass accretion
rate (X corresponds to dM/dt = 2e-10 Msun/yr, while B to 1e-11 Msun/yr), # is the number of models in the evolutionary sequence,
and "mixed" means that the WD was accreting a mixture of equal amounts (50%) of WD and solar-composition materials.

These directories also contain the file with the accreted composition, ne_wd_MWD_mixed.ppn, and the file with
the solar composition, Solar_Composition.

In the MPPNP post-processing computations, a list of 147 isotopes, falk_isotopedatabase.txt, has been used.
It is placed in the directory ppd.

A table below gives the maximum mass interval over which the abundances can be averaged in the envelope, and
the range of model numbers that were processed.
