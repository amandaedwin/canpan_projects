! Some other parameters concernng grid refinement:

        msl = 5000   ! maximum number of spatial zones
        nrefmax = 23 ! refinement level
        gfdim = 20   ! max num of refinement species


   ! the parameter values are given as fortran95 "namelists"
   ! here's a brief summary of how things work with namelists.

   ! each line in a namelist is of the form   name = value ! comment

   ! each name must be declared as a control in the program,
   ! but you don't need to include all of the controls in the list.
   ! and the order of the list doesn't matter.
   ! blank lines and comment lines can be freely included in the list.
   ! blanks at the start of a line containing a name-value pair are okay too.

   ! all of the controls are given reasonable default values at initialization.
   ! so you only need to set the ones that you actually want to change

   ! if you don't want to change a control, but you do want to keep in the list,
   ! either comment out the line, or leave the value field blank.

   ! fortran supports structured values in namelists (arrays and derived types),
   ! but for simplicity, we only use basic types (integers, doubles, logicals, strings).

   ! values are given using the usual fortran syntax.
   ! for example, character string values are enclosed in quotes

   ! ****** REMINDER ******
   ! A '/' character terminates the namelist.
   ! So, do not use '/' outside of comments or strings.
   ! In particular, don't write something like 1d0/3d0 as a value.
