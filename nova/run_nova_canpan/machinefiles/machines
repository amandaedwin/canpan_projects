# the run_me.sh run script assumes that you are running on a
# cluster with a bunch of possibly inhomogeneous nodes; these
# could be the workstations of your co-workers! on each of these
# nodes there is a maximum number of cores you may wish to use
# (to ensure that your colleages have one or two cores left
# to read their email). This max number of slot can be specified by
# max_slots: the max number of slots you want to use on that host.
# the --bynode option in the mpiexec launch command takes care
# of the roun-robin by node allocation that is prefered for the
# mppnp code 

# total: 76
